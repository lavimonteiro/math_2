Diamonds are still regarded as the pinnacle of luxury in jewelery since they have been prized as jewels from ancient times and are admired for their brilliance. Diamonds are treasured for much more than just their alluring beauty, though. They have different qualities that allow people to use it for many different purposes such as a cutting tool, and other tasks requiring durability. This makes diamonds valued beyond all other stones due to their distinctive physical characteristics and are the most popular gemstone in the world."
