    "Throughout history, people have been drawn to exquisite, unique items. Diamonds are still regarded as the pinnacle of luxury in jewelery since they have been prized as jewels from ancient times and are admired for their brilliance. Diamonds are treasured for much more than just their alluring beauty, though. They have different qualities that allow people to use it for many different purposes such as a cutting tool, and other tasks requiring durability. This makes diamonds valued beyond all other stones due to their distinctive physical characteristics and are the most popular gemstone in the world."

    "Because of these different aspects that we discussed, a predictive model for diamonds' prices would have many practical use and applications in the real world. For example, it could help buyers determine if the price of a singular diamond is reasonable. Potential sellers of jewelry could also use this model to predict an estimate of the price of their diamond."

The first one is to predict the price of diamonds based on a number of different features, and which features appear to be the greatest indicators or predictors of the diamonds' prices. In addition to that, after some data preprocessing and preparation, which is the focus of this Phase 1 report, the second goal is to undertake some exploratory data analysis using basic descriptive statistics and data visualisation plots to obtain some insight into the patterns and correlations existent in the data."
