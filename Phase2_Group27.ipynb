    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1 Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the Phase one of this project, we aimed to complete Data preparation and Visualisation of the \"Diamonds\" dataset sourced from Kaggle, where nearly 54,000 diamonds were analysed. The Target Feature chosen for the study was the price of diamonds in US dollars, and the explanatory variables included Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Table, price, depth percentage, depth, length, width. Presumptions such as that the dataset's rows were not associated were made, allowing us to utilise traditional predictive models such as multiple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Phase one multiple data cleaning and preprocessing steps were taken, these steps encompasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Checking for missing values</b><br>\n",
    "Upon checking, no missing values were found\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Checking for incorrect values for both numerical and categorical features</b><br>\n",
    "This included checking for value that are inherently incorrect, such as negative values for prices or values that which were not listed as one of the options for categorical features. This examination indicated the existence of outliers for columns such as carat, price, width, depth, length\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Calculating and removing outliers</b><br>\n",
    "All features mentioned above were checked for outliers and removed accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Aggregation</b><br>\n",
    "This step included encoding the categorical columns (cut, color, clarity). As all variables were ordinals, integer-encoding was completed\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5. Renaming column</b><br>\n",
    "Columns that had confusing or non-descriptive names were renamed, this includes depth, x, y, z, which were renamed to depth percentage, length, width and depth accordingly \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>6. Random Sampling</b><br>\n",
    "As the dataset had a significant number of rows, a ransom sample of 500 Rows were taken\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent to preprocessing steps, data exploration and visualisation was completed, where through a mix of univariable, two variable, and three Variable plots, the impact of various descriptive features on price of diamond were explored. The visualisations included a range of graphs, such as box plots, histograms, and scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this exploration we determined that the size of a diamond (evident through features such as length, width, depth and carat) had the most significant influence on price. Furthermore, other features such as cut and clarity also impacted price, where if a diamond of similar sizes were compared, the one with a greater scores for either of the aforementioned features would have a greater price. Conversely, the clarity scores feature seemed to not have a notice impact on price, it was discovered that bigger diamonds often has lower clarity grades, however further investigation regarding this would be necessary to confirm this relationship."
